# Core Concepts

In addition to understanding what Engines are and how they differ from Applications, there are a few core concepts worth understanding before attempting to create and use them.

## Addons & In-Repo-Addons

As mentioned above, Engines are a specific type of Addon. This makes sense given that Addons are a way to easily share common or reusable code. Since Engines are intended to package logical applications that can be composed, they should fit nicely into the paradigm of shareable addons.

In-Repo-Addons

I would recommend reading through the "[Developing Addons & Blueprints](http://ember-cli.com/extending/#developing-addons-and-blueprints)" portion of the Ember-CLI user guide before moving onto the "Creating A New Engine" portion of the guide.

## Isolation & Dependencies

## Routable Vs. Route-less

Finally, there are two types of Engines that you could potentially encounter: routable and route-less.
